# Description
The aim of this application is to be used as a budget tracker which allows for offline access and functionality.
The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, this will populate the total when brought back online.


This application runs on Heroku. 

# Installation 

You can use the deployed application [here](https://budget-tracker-olivia-owen.herokuapp.com/)

In order to use this application you will need to open the deployed application on Heroku.

From here you will be presented with a blank graph, you will be able to start logging the money you have gained and spent using the form above.

You are still able to enter transactions when you are offlien and these will fully populate as soon as you come back online.
